 * the previous time when you translated the tool object you created 5 different objects with suffexes like _ar, however i don't want that.
 * just create 5 new objects with the same name edit_page and the same keys but with different string values for each language.
 * also each object created should be of type _edit_page.
 * i.e it should be somthing like this for all of the objects:
 * export const edit_page: _edit_page = {...}
 * do this because all of the objects that you'll create should be of the edit_page type which is the following:
 * type edit_page = {
    edit_page_titles: {
        organize_pdf: string;
    };
    loader_text: string;
    add_more_button: string;

    pages: string;
    page: string;
} all of them should satisfy this type please do it as i told you.
